# **Introduction**

Exploratory Data analysis or EDA is summarizing and exploring data&#39;s main characteristics and plots them into graphs.

This process seems pretty boring but it&#39;s very important to get a sense of data and to discover anomalies or handling missing and duplicated data.

This notebook explores the supermarket data set and tries to understand its details.
